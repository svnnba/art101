					 <h2>Challenge</h2>
						<p>Work with peers to create a functioning JS file, i believe. And this time, I actually HAVE peers, and they're awesome. Working with people coding is so much better than working alone, and made thr challenge of even coding, easier..</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
						<p>Not many, and that's what's superised me. Usually when I work on Labs, I come across them unifinished or unmarked because there was a problem I couldn't bypass. For this Lab however, every problem I had was eventually solved and I slowly began to understand this numeric world. </p>
		

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
						<p>THIS ASSIGNMENT WAS AWESOME!!! So far, this one has been my favorite! I had alot of fun choosing out cars, and getting the grasp of the material. When I first started this Lab. I looked at the taks in complete & utter dissarray. None of it made sense to me, and it still doesn't but I managed to complete the Lab anyway! It's a victory to me! Also Mini Coopers are awesome. I love annoying tiny cars.  </p>
