					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Using the confusing system  of API's & JSON websites, embed another wesbite into your own- close to Lab 15 but this time we focus more on the graphical aspect.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>My computer at the lab locked me out so I had to REDO ALL MY WORK & PROGRESS. Not a fun time. I also had to switch to firefox to use my wwebsite because the add-on function worked very weirdly with chrome.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>In this reflection, I am very thankful for my partner Liam, Chatgpt, my roomates and my cat because I don't think I could've done it without them honestly.</p>
